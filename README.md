# loin-feeder-robot

This project is to design the control systems for a robot that feeds the loin puller at Hylife Foods Ltd. The mechanical design for this system was done by a team of student from the University of Manitoba (Christopher Mckay, Zheng Fan, Dylan Van Deynze, David Lubi). 

This software aims at solving three challenges:
* Develop a vision system that allows the robot to determine the size, orientation, and proper cut line on travelling hogs. 
* Develop an algorithm that plans the actuator paths required to align the hogs in the proper orientation. 
* Program the appropriate PLCs to actuate the path determined on the physical build.
